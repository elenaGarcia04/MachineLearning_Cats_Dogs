# MachineLearning_Cats_Dogs
This project is a Machine Learning model designed to classify images as either dogs or cats. It involves:

Data preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and augmentation of images to improve model performance.

Model training: using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn patterns and features from the images.

Evaluation: testing the model on a separate dataset to measure accuracy and performance.

Goal: create an automated classifier capable of distinguishing between dog and cat images with high accuracy, demonstrating practical applications of ML in image recognition.
